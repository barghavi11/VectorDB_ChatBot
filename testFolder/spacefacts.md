# Amazing Space Facts

## Mind-Blowing Cosmic Phenomena

**One day on Venus** is longer than one year on Venus. Venus rotates so slowly that it takes 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun.

**Neutron stars** are so dense that a teaspoon of neutron star material would weigh about 6 billion tons - roughly the same as Mount Everest.

**The Great Wall of China** is actually NOT visible from space with the naked eye, despite the popular myth. This misconception has persisted for decades.

**Saturn's moon Titan** has lakes and rivers, but they're made of liquid methane and ethane instead of water.

**If you could drive a car to space** at highway speeds (60 mph), it would take you about an hour to reach space, but over 4,000 years to reach the Moon.

## Solar System Oddities

**Jupiter acts as Earth's protector** by using its massive gravitational pull to attract asteroids and comets that might otherwise hit our planet.

**Mars has the largest volcano** in the solar system - Olympus Mons is nearly three times taller than Mount Everest.

**There are more possible games of chess** than there are atoms in the observable universe.

**A day on Mercury** lasts 176 Earth days, meaning you'd have two birthdays before experiencing one complete day-night cycle.

**The Milky Way galaxy** is on a collision course with the Andromeda galaxy, but don't worry - the collision won't happen for another 4.5 billion years.
