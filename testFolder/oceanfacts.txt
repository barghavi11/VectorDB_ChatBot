MYSTERIOUS OCEAN FACTS

1. We've explored less than 5% of Earth's oceans. We know more about the surface of Mars than our own ocean floors.

2. The ocean contains 99% of Earth's living space, yet most of it remains completely unexplored.

3. Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to their gills, while the third pumps blood to the rest of their body.

4. The Mariana Trench is so deep that if Mount Everest were placed at its bottom, the peak would still be over a mile underwater.

5. Some fish in the deep ocean create their own light through bioluminescence. Over 80% of deep-sea creatures can produce light.

6. There are underwater waterfalls in the ocean caused by differences in water density and temperature.

7. The blue whale's heart is so large that a small child could crawl through its arteries.

8. Seahorses are the only species where the male gives birth to babies instead of the female.

9. A group of jellyfish is called a "smack," and some jellyfish species are technically immortal.

10. The ocean produces over 70% of Earth's oxygen - more than all the rainforests combined.

11. Sound travels 4 times faster in water than in air, which is why whales can communicate across vast ocean distances.

12. The pressure at the deepest part of the ocean is equivalent to having 50 jumbo jets pressing down on every square meter.
